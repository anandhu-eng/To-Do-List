Hi, I'm Anandhu. Im a student developer

I have taken this project inorder to get familiarity with the python gui module called the Tkinter and backend database operations using MySQL.

NOTE:
    This project has not been given a exe file.

About the project:
  This is a simple  to-do-list program or you can say it as a prototype of the original one.
  MySQL is used in this project for backend database support.
  This project covers the basic MySQL operations like addition, deletion.
 
Miscelleanious:
  It took be around 3 weeks for this version to be released.I had encountered several harsh situation.Even the complete code was spoiled and i had to
  rewrite them all again.
  It did give me great experiance on the challenges that the programmers face during their development journey.
  
Modifications that are required per usage:
  Remaining task should be automatically be visible after clicking the delete button.
  Window should be kept at the centre of the screen.
  Intro page should be added
  Feature to delete task by giving only their slno should be added.
  
My Word:
  The project is not stopped here. Even i would start developping and focusing energies on new projects, i would be constantly improving this.
  There will be more upcomming versions of the same project and it will be numbered like 1.1,1.2,.....etc. 
  It would be given version 2 only if there is some major deviation from the initial design and features in it.
  
Happy Programming!!!
