Hi, I'm Anandhu. Im a student developer

I have taken this project inorder to get familiarity with the python gui module called the Tkinter and backend database operations using MySQL.

NOTE:
    This project has not been given a exe file.

About the project:
  This is a simple  to-do-list program or you can say it as a prototype of the original one.
  MySQL is used in this project for backend database support.
  This project covers the basic MySQL operations like addition, deletion.
 
Miscelleanious:
  It took be around 3 weeks for this version to be released.I had encountered several harsh situation.Even the complete code was spoiled and i had to
  rewrite them all again.
  It did give me great experiance on the challenges that the programmers face during their development journey.
  
My Word:
  The project is not stopped here. Even i would start developping and focusing energies on new projects, i would be constantly improving this.
  There will be more upcomming versions of the same project and it will be numbered like 1.1,1.2,.....etc. 
  It would be given version 2 only if there is some major deviation from the initial design and features in it.
  
Happy Programming!!!
